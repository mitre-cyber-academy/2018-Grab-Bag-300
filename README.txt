Players are given a game where they must complete a boss battle to obtain the MCA flag. The flag is not in the game so strings-ing it won't work. The flag is generated based on how many points the player gets, The point value is determine by a semi-complex forumla that only incrments when the players shoots the boss. so number of bullets that hit the boss = the points. The boss takes a set number of bullets to destroy it. The point value should be displayed as 1230 when the boss dies. There is probably a decimal that is not shown but that decimal does go towards the creation of the flag, the points value is hashed with MD5 when the boss dies and is displayed. The flag is MCA{ed3df47e943c1c37c1099bd67e7a2477}
